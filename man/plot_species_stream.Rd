\title{Plot Species Stream}
\usage{
plot_species_stream(
  df,
  confidence = 0,
  bird.names = unique(df$`Common Name`),
  bw = 0.75
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame representing BirdNET results, ideally created by \code{read_birdnet_file} or \code{read_birdnet_folder}.
Must contain columns: \code{start_time}, \verb{Common Name}, and \code{Confidence}.}

\item{confidence}{Numeric. The minimum confidence level (0-1) for species identifications to be included.
Defaults to 0.}

\item{bird.names}{Character vector. One or more species names ("Common Name") to visualize.
Defaults to all unique species in the provided dataframe.}

\item{bw}{Numeric. The bandwidth for the kernel density estimation performed by \code{ggstream}.
Adjusts the smoothness of the stream. Defaults to 0.75.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the streamgraph of species calls over time.
}
\description{
Creates a streamgraph showing the number of calls over time for selected species. This visualization
allows for the comparison of species prevalence across different times or seasons.
}
\details{
This function requires the \code{ggstream} package to be installed. It filters the data based on the provided
confidence threshold and species names, then aggregates the count of calls per day.
The resulting plot is a "ridge" type streamgraph.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'results' is a dataframe from read_birdnet_folder()
# Plot stream for specific species with a confidence threshold
plot_species_stream(results, confidence = 0.5, bird.names = c("Galah", "Magpie-lark"))
}

# Runnable example with mock data
