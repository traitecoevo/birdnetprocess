\title{Summarise Detections}
\usage{
summarise_detections(df, confidence = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe of BirdNET results, typically created by
\code{\link{read_birdnet_file}} or \code{\link{read_birdnet_folder}}.}

\item{confidence}{Numeric. The minimum confidence level (0 to 1) for a detection
to be included in the summary. Default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{statistic} and \code{value}.
}
\description{
Provides a quick summary of BirdNET results, including species counts,
total recordings, time range, and average detection rates.
}
\details{
This function filters the input data based on the provided confidence threshold
and then calculates several summary statistics:
\itemize{
\item Number of unique species detected
\item Total number of detections (recordings)
\item Date range of the recording window
\item The most frequently detected species
\item The peak hour of activity
\item Average number of detections per day
\item Average number of detections per hour
}
It returns a tibble with two columns: \code{statistic} (the name of the metric)
and \code{value} (the calculated value formatted as a string).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Summarise with default confidence (0.5)
summarise_detections(df)

# Summarise with higher confidence threshold
summarise_detections(df, confidence = 0.8)
}
}
